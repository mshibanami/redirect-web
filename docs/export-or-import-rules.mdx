# Export/Import Rules

## Export Rules

### Export on macOS

Click either the ellipsis button or the Share button as shown in this screenshot:

![Share on macOS](/img/share-on-macos.png)

You can also multi-select your rules and export them by secondary clicking (right-clicking) them on the rule-listing sidebar:

In addition, you can export all the rules by the menubar > File > Export All Rules:

![Menubar > File](/img/menubar-file.png)

If you want to export your rules in the format compatible with [Einar Egilsson's Redirector](https://einaregilsson.com/redirector/), press the Option key (`âŒ¥`) on the context menu or the menubar, then you'll see these:

![Context Menu (Redirector)](/img/context-menu-redirector.png)

> [!WARNING]
> Redirect Web is not fully compatible with Redirector, and vise versa. Some settings, such as "Replace Occurrences" for Capturing Group Processing, aren't exported with the Redirector's format.

### Export on iOS

You can export your rules like this:

## Import Rules

### Import on macOS

- Simply drag and drop the exported rule files to Redirect Web's window.
- Or, you can also import them from the menubar > File > Import Rules

### Import on iOS

Suppose your rule file is in the Files app. Open it on Files, tap the Share button, and then select Redirect Web:

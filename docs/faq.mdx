# FAQ

## Why should I allow the extension to read/change my information? {#why-allow-extension-to-read-change}

You may see an alert like this when you set up Redirect Web:

<IfBrowserStore stores='appStore'>
    <Image src={PermissionAlertSafari} alt="An permission requiring alert" width="200" margin="0 0 16px 0" hasShadow />

    > This extension will be able to read and alter webpages and see your browsing history on this website. **This could include sensitive information, including passwords, phone numbers, and credit cards.**
</IfBrowserStore>

<IfBrowserStore stores='appStore' includes={false}>
    <Image src={PermissionAlertChrome} alt="An permission requiring alert" height="200" hasRoundedCorners hasShadow margin="0 0 16px 0" />

    > It can:  
    > Read and change **all your data** on **all websites**
</IfBrowserStore>

This extension needs your permission to observe the page navigation to redirect to wherever you want to jump, and your browser displays this when the extension requests the related permissions. Therefore, if you don’t allow it, this extension can't work.

Granted permissions will only be used for app functions like redirection, in compliance with the **[the privacy policy](./privacy-policy)**.

## Should I still get the app after installing the extension for Chrome, Firefox, or Edge? {#app-for-non-safari-browsers}

Yes. You must download [the Redirect Web app from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1571283503) regardless of which browser you use. You can install the extension from your browser’s extension store, but the app is required to manage your rules, purchase history, and other settings across devices via iCloud.

## Does Redirect Web work on Windows, Android, Linux, or any other platforms? {#non-apple-platforms}

Not at this time. Redirect Web is closely tied to Apple's ecosystem, including iCloud and Universal Purchase. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## Why not [Redirector](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector)? {#why-not-redirector}

Redirector is still a great redirection extension. It's completely free, open-source, and works on non-Apple platforms too. But Redirect Web has some extra features you might like:

* **Detailed Rule Settings:** Multiple exclude patterns, multiple process matches, and string replacements features available only in Redirect Web.
* **Open in native apps:** On Mac, you can choose where to open the target URL. (It calls the `open` command directly. Not deep links.)
* **[DNR](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2023/05/17/declarativenetrequest-available-in-firefox/) support:** Provides blazing-fast redirection.
* **Centralized rule management:** Manage rules for all browsers in one place via the native app.
* **Manifest V3 & V2 support:** Helpful while V2 is being phased out in Chrome.

## Why does this extension require a new permission? {#permission-alert-on-safari}

You may see this alert in Safari after updating Redirect Web:

<img src={require("/img/safari-additional-permission-alert.webp").default} alt="An alert of disabling the app" width="280" />

> "Redirect Web" has been updated and is requesting additional permissions. To protect your privacy, this extension has been turned off.
>
> You can turn this extension on in the Extensions section of Safari Settings.

This is due to the [declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/blocking_content_with_your_safari_web_extension) permission required by the [DNR](./rule-settings#type) type introduced in version 7. Please re-enable the extension. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## Will the library's contents become paid in the future? {#will-library-become-paid}

No, it's always free. You can also find the source of all the contents [here](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web/tree/main/library).

## One-time Purchase or Annual Subscription: Which is Best? {#one-time-or-subscription}

We recommend the one-time purchase, as the price difference is only US$2.00.
The main reason we offer the subscription is to allow you to try all the features through its free trial. Here is the expected use case:

1. Subscribe to the annual subscription.
2. Immediately cancel the subscription by going to the Settings app, searching for "Subscriptions", tapping on this app, and selecting "Cancel Subscription". This lets you enjoy the free trial without any commitment.
3. Enjoy full access to all features for 7 days.
4. If you like the features, opt for the one-time purchase.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with continuing with the annual subscription if you prefer!

## Does Redirect Web inject ads or other unrelated content into websites? {#does-it-inject-ads}

No, it does not inject any such content. Only code that is necessary to provide the features described in this documentation and on the app page in the App Store is injected into websites on Safari.

## Is there any chance Redirect Web could ever be sold to someone else? {#could-it-be-sold}

100% no. Browser extensions wield deep control over your browsing and data, and handing Redirect Web over to another owner would open the door to privacy violations. We’ve seen extensions change hands and then harvest user data or inject ads without warning. That will never happen here. For more on these risks, see Matt Frisbie’s article ["The Ugly Business of Monetizing Browser"](https://mattfrisbie.substack.com/p/the-ugly-business-of-monetizing-browser) and Brian Krebs’ investigation ["Is Your Browser Extension a Botnet Backdoor?"](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/is-your-browser-extension-a-botnet-backdoor/).

Redirect Web is founded on trust and responsibility. We consider it our duty to keep your information safe, and we refuse to transfer ownership under any circumstances. Redirect Web will always remain in our hands, so you can browse with complete confidence.

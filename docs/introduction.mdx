Welcome to the support website for Redirect Web, a browser extension that can redirect all page loads in your browser, so you always land where you want.

Redirect Web is available on **Mac** in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and more, as well as on **iPhone**, **iPad**, and **Apple Vision Pro** in Safari.

- ‚¨áÔ∏è Safari extension is bundled with [the native app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1571283503).

:::note

- Even if you don't use Safari, you still need to download [the Redirect Web app from the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1571283503) to use the extension on non-Safari browsers, as the extensions must communicate with the app to access your rules, settings, and more. The app will automatically detect the installed browsers and activate the extension for them.
- The multi-browser support is only available on Mac.

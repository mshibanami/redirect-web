Welcome to the support website for Redirect Web, a browser extension for macOS and iOS.

This is a browser extension that redirects all page loads in your browser, so you always land where you want.

## Use Cases

For example, you can create these rules:

- Remove unneeded parameters from a URL
- Open a Google Meet link on Google Chrome
- Open a Notion's link on the Notion app

You can find useful rules in these:

- [Library](library): This offers you many useful pre-defined rules you can easily get by tapping a Get button.
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web/discussions/categories/redirect-rules): A community forum where the users can share their rules with others.

## Features

Redirect Web comes with the following features:

- Create rules using Regular Expression or Wildcard pattern types
- Use back-referencing to specify dynamic target URLs
- Exclude URLs from redirection
- Process captured text using URL encoding/decoding, base64 encoding/decoding, or replacing occurrences

In addition, you can unlock the following features through either a subscription or a one-time purchase:

- Enabling 2 or more rules
- Syncing rules with your other Mac, iPhone, and iPad via iCloud

Purchasing the app also supports us in maintaining Redirect Web. ðŸ˜ƒ

Your purchase made on your iOS device can be used on your Mac and vice versa.

# Library

Welcome to our library, where you can find useful ready-to-use rules for free! You can access them through the Redirect Web app.

To copy the rules to My Rules, you can simply select Get button:

<Image src={LibraryGetButtonIOS} alt="Get Button - iOS" hasShadow hasRoundedCorners/>

## Contribute your rule to the library

The current library has only a few rules, so we appreciate your contribution!

There are 2 options to contribute your rules to the library:

1. **Post your rule on the Forum**: Share your redirect rule with other users on [the forum](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web/discussions/categories/redirect-rules). Then we may request if we could put your rule in the library as well. This might be easier than option 2 because you can leave the addition to us.
2. **Send us a pull request**: You can send us a pull request. Please check [the instructions](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web/tree/main/library) to learn more.

## Other Information

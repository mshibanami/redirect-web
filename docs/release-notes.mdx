# Release Notes

## Version 7.12.0 (Current)

![Supported Platforms: iOS and macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platforms-iOS%20|%20macOS-white)

* **[macOS]** Fixed an issue where the app initiated redirection while the user was still typing in the address bar. This occurred when a rule was set to redirect to another application.
* **[macOS]** Adjusted the color of the buttons in dark mode for improved visibility. It was too vivid.
* Other minor improvements and bug fixes.

## Version 7.11.0

* Fixed an issue where the Rule Details screen in the Library showed nothing on iOS 17 or earlier, and macOS Sonoma or earlier.

## New Features in Version 7

- **New Redirection Type**

    ![Supported Platforms: iOS and macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platforms-iOS%20|%20macOS-white)

    We have added a new redirection type called **DNR**.
    It allows you to redirect anything, including iframes, images, JavaScript, etc. (Finally!)
    Moreover, it works much faster than the original redirection type.

    > [!WARNING]
    > After updating the app, you may see an alert in Safari that disables the extension due to a new permission requested. This is because the DNR type requires it to work. Please re-enable the extension. Sorry for the inconvenience.

    Learn more about the DNR type [here](rule-settings#type).

- **App Lock (Version 7.2 or later)**

    ![Supported Platforms: iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platforms-iOS-white)
    
    You can now secure both the app and the extension. It's perfect for use with parental controls. Set it up in Settings > App Lock. (Note: This feature is not available on macOS.)

# Rule Settings

This page provides detailed information of each setting in the Edit Rule screen in the Redirect Web app.

## Options

### Type

Specify the **Type** option to control how the app handles redirection. You can choose from these:

* **Original** (Default)
    * This uses traditional Web APIs to control redirection. Additionally, it uses [the Tabs API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs) for a fallback.
        * In Firefox, it uses the [WebRequest API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest) to handle redirection.
    * You can use all the options other than [Resource Types](#resource-types) and [Request Methods](#request-methods).
    * This is slower than the *Declarative* type and may cause extra network requests.
* **DNR** (Experimental for Safari):
    * This type works much faster than the Original type because it doesn't initiate a network request for the source URL.
    * This allows you to specify [Resource Types](#resource-types) and [Request Methods](#request-methods).
    * ⚠️ You can't use some options, such as [Capturing Group Processing](#capturing-group-processing) and [Excluded URL Patterns](#excluded-url-patterns) since they haven't been supported by the DNR API yet.
    * ⚠️ In Safari, currently you can't include pipes (`|`) in your Regular Expression pattern. [Details](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web/issues/44)
    * ⚠️ Since Safari's DNR API still has some issues, we consider that is still an experimental feature for Safari. You can find the list of all the known issues [here](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3ADNR%20label%3ASafari).

### Redirect From

The **Redirect From** option allows you to specify a URL pattern of web pages you want to redirect from. You can choose either [Wildcard](#wildcard) or [Regular Expression](#regular-expression).

For example, if you specify `https://example.com/*` with Wildcard, it matches `https://example.com/` or `https://example.com/hello`.

> [!NOTE]
> In the Redirect To option, You can reference the entire match using `$0` or partial matches using `$1`, `$2`, ... Check the details in [URL Pattern](#url-pattern) on this page.

#### Resource Types

![Supported Types: DNR](https://img.shields.io/badge/Types-DNR-blue)

The **Resource Types** option lets you specify the categories of web requests, such as images, JavaScripts, and style sheets, to which the rule applies.
For example, if you set `script`, you can redirect the JavaScript files loaded by web pages.

Currently, these are available: 
`main_frame`, `sub_frame`, `stylesheet`, `script`, `image`, `font`, `xmlhttprequest`, `ping`, `media`, `websocket`, `other`

The default setting is `main_frame`, which is the top-level page loaded into a tab.

Please check the details of each resource type in [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/declarativeNetRequest/ResourceType).

#### Request Methods

![Supported Types: DNR](https://img.shields.io/badge/Types-DNR-blue)

The **Request Methods** option lets you set the target HTTP methods of the source URL.

All methods are set by default.

Please check the details of each method in [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

> [!WARNING]
> In Safari, this option may not be available because Apple's implementation for the DNR type doesn't seem to handle it currently. We sent feedback to Apple as FB14502272.

#### Target Browsers

![Supported Platforms: macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platforms-macOS-white)

The **Target Browsers** option allows you to specify which browser the rule should or shouldn't be applied to.

* There are 2 types of browsers you can choose:
    * **Browsers you can choose by default**: You can choose Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Arc, Brave, and Vivaldi by default. This doesn't differentiate variants of the same browser, such as Safari and Safari Technology Preview.
    * **User specified browsers**: By tapping the Add button on the popover, you can select any browser other than Safari or Safari Technology Preview that has the Redirect Web extension installed.
* The **All except selected** checkbox lets you target every browser except the ones you’ve chosen.

> [!WARNING]
> Redirect Web can't differentiate whether the browser is **Safari** or **Safari Technology Preview** because the app checks the parent process of the extension to detect it but these two browsers share the same parent process (`/sbin/launchd`).

### Redirect To

The **Redirect To** option specifies a destination URL you wish to redirect to, from the source URL matched with the *Redirect From* option. You can also substitute capturing groups with `$1`, `$2`, ... or the entire match with `$0`. These help you dynamically specify the destination. Check the details in [URL Pattern](#url-pattern) in this page.

For example, if you set the following rule:

* **Redirect From**: `https://google.com/*` (Wildcard)
* **Redirect To**: `https://apple.com/$1`

and it matches `https://google.com/hello`, then the destination URL will be `https://apple.com/hello`.

Additionally, You can modify the texts of `$1`, `$2`, ... before making substitutions. Check the [Capturing Group Processing](#capturing-group-processing) section for the details.

> [!TIP]
> You can specify a custom URL scheme to open an app. These are examples of apps that support deep linking:
>
> * Figma: `figma://file/Your_Figma_ID`
> * Firefox: `firefox://open-url?url=https://example.com/hello`
> * Google Chrome: `googlechromes://example.com`
> * Microsoft Edge: `microsoft-edge://example.com`
> * Notion: `notion://www.notion.so/Your_Note_ID`
> * Slack: `slack://open`

#### Application

![Supported Types: Original](https://img.shields.io/badge/Types-Original-blue) ![Supported Platforms: macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platforms-macOS-white)

If you want to specify an app you wish to open the destination URL, use the **Application** combo box. This is only available on macOS.

> [!WARNING]
> You can only open an app that supports [App Sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app_sandbox). Also, make sure that the app supports opening the URL you want to open.

### Capturing Group Processing

![Supported Types: Original](https://img.shields.io/badge/Types-Original-blue)

The **Capturing Group Processing** option allows you to specify how to process the captured groups you can substitute in the *Redirect To* option with `$1`, `$2`...

These are how to make capturing groups:

* **Wildcard**: Texts matched with `*` and `?` are automatically captured.
* **Regular Expression**: Texts matched with part of the pattern inside `()` are captured.

You can choose one or more of the following processes:

* **URL Encode/Decode**: This applies [percent-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) or decoding to a capturing group. For example, if you encode `https://example.com/hello`, it's converted to `https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fhello`. Decode works in the opposite way.
* **Base64 Encode/Decode**: This decode/encode a text into [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64). For example, you can encode `hello` to `aGVsbG8=`, and decode it back to `hello`.
* **Replace Occurrences**: This replaces one or more characters in a group, matched by a **Target**, with a **Replacement**. For example, if the *Group* is `hello` and the *Target* is `l` and the Replacement is `y`, it is modified to `heyyo`.

> [!NOTE]
> This is for processing each capturing group and it doesn't affect which URLs are excluded by the [Excluded URL Patterns](#excluded-url-patterns). For instance, let's say you have this rule:
>
> * **Redirect From**: `https://example.com/(hello.*)`
> * **Capturing Group Processing**:
>     * Group: `$1`
>     * Target: `.*` (Regular Expression)
>     * Replacement: `hello`
> * **Excluded URL Pattern**: `https://example.com/hello`
>
> In this case, `https://example.com/hello_world` will not be excluded while `https://example.com/hello` will be excluded.

### Excluded URL Patterns

![Supported Types: Original](https://img.shields.io/badge/Types-Original-blue)

The **Excluded URL Patterns** option allows you to specify the URLs that are not redirected. This can be useful to avoid redirect loops or to exclude certain parts of a website from being redirected.

You can specify excluded URL patterns using either Regular Expression or Wildcard pattern types.

### Examples

The **Examples** option allows you to test your redirect rule by providing sample URLs. By adding a sample URL, you can check if the rule works as expected before actually applying it.

### Comments

The **Comments** option allows you to add any notes or comments about your redirect rule. This can be useful for keeping track of why you created a specific rule or for providing context for others who might view your rules.

## URL Pattern

There are 3 options you can specify one or more URL patterns. *Redirect From*, *Excluded URL Patterns* and *Capturing Group Processing*. To specify them, you can choose either **Wildcard** or **Regular Expression**.

### Wildcard

**Wildcard** is a simpler pattern type that allows you to use `*` (matches anything) and `?`  (matches any single character) as wildcards. Here are some examples:

* To match `https://example.com/hello`, you can use `https://example.com/*`. This will match any string after `https://example.com/`.
* To match `https://example.com/search?q=hello`, you can use `https://example.com/search?q=*`. This will match any value for the `q` parameter.
* To match any URL that contains the word `blog`, you can use `*blog*`.

You can also use substitution in Wildcard as well, which means you can reference portions of the matched URL using `$1`, `$2`, etc. For example, if you use `https://example.com/*-world-*`, and the URL is `https://example.com/hello-world-goodbye`, then `$1` would be "hello" and `$2` would be "goodbye". `$0` is also available to reference the entire URL matched.

> [!Note]
> Although substitution is a feature of Regular Expression, you can also use it for Wildcard because Redirect Web internally converts Wildcard to Regular Expression.

### Regular Expression

**Regular Expression** (Regex) is a powerful tool for matching patterns in text, powered by Apple's regular expression engine which is described [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsregularexpression#1661042). It allows you to define a specific pattern that matches a set of strings. Here are some examples.

- To match `https://example.com/hello`, you can use `https://example.com/(.*)`. This will match any string after `https://example.com/` and store it in a capturing group.
- To match `https://example.com/search?q=hello`, you can use `https://example.com/search\?q=(.*)`. This will match the value of the `q` parameter and store it in a capturing group.
- To match any URL that contains the word `blog`, you can use `.*blog.*`.

You can reference the capturing groups in *Redirect To* or *Replacement* using `$1`, `$2`, ... or `$0` to reference the entire match.

More information about Regex syntax can be found in resources like [RegExr](https://regexr.com/).

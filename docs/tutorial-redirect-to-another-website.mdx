# Case 1: Redirect to another website

Suppose you're addicted to Twitter, and you decide to meditate using Insight Timer whenever you accidentally open Twitter. Let's create a rule for that!

### Step 1. Open the "Edit Rule" screen

Let's open the *Edit Rule* screen to start creating your own rule in the app. You can do this by clicking the plus (+) button in the *My Rules* tab.

### Step 2. Set up "Redirect From"

First, you should set up the *Redirect From* section in the *Edit Rule* screen in the app. The targets are URLs starting with `https://twitter.com/`.

In this case, you can specify the following pattern with the [Wildcard](/rule-settings#url-pattern-wildcard) mode:

```
https://twitter.com/*
```

In the Wildcard mode, `*` means it matches anything (= zero or more characters).

However, hold on. `twitter.com` was renamed to `x.com`. You can simply replace `twitter.com` with `x.com` but no one knows when the new owner will change his mind again to roll it back. Therefore, let's target both `twitter.com` and `x.com`.

To do that, switch from Wildcard to [Regular Expression](/rule-settings#url-pattern-regular-expression), and set this as the pattern:

```
https://(twitter|x).com/.*
```

* `(twitter|x)`: it targets both `twitter` and `x`. (`|` is called *a pipe*.)
* `.*`: It's the same as Wildcard's `*`. More specifically, `.` means *any character* and `*` means *anything before this symbol repeated any number of times*, resulting in it matches anything.

Regular Expression is a bit complicated, but once you get used to it, it will be a powerful tool. We recommend using [RegExr](https://regexr.com) as a playground to analyze how your Regular Expression pattern works.

> [!TIP]
> In Regular Expressions, `.` in `(twitter|x).com` is also treated as *any character*. Therefore, `(twitter|x).com/.*` also matches, for example, `twitter1com/` or `x_com/`.
>
> To be more precise, you can change it to `(twitter|x)\.com/.*`. `\` is used to treat `.` as a literal period character rather than a special character.
>
> However, there are no such URLs in the general internet environment. Therefore, you can leave `.` as a special character if you prefer.

### Step 3: Set up "Redirect To"

Simply specify the URL as follows:

```
https://insighttimer.com/saraauster/guided-meditations/calm
```

### (Optional) Step 4: Check the rule

You can check how the rule works by adding a example URL in the *Examples* section in the *Edit Rule* screen. For instance, if you enter `https://x.com/UN`, it shows `https://insighttimer.com/saraauster/guided-meditations/calm` as the result.

Here's what your rule should look like now:

**<a href={useBaseUrl('rules/reduce-twitter-addiction.redirectweb')} download>⬇️ Download the Rule</a>**

Now, Redirect Web brings you to the meditation when you access Twitter!

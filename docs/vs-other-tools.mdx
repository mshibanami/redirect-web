## Why not [Redirector](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector)? {#redirector}

Redirector is a great browser extension for redirection. It's completely free, open-source, and works on non-Apple platforms too. But Redirect Web has some extra features you might like:

* **Detailed Rule Settings:** Multiple exclude patterns, multiple process matches, and string replacements features available only in Redirect Web.
* **Open in native apps:** On Mac, you can choose where to open the target URL. (It calls the `open` command directly. Not a deep linking.)
* **[DNR](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2023/05/17/declarativenetrequest-available-in-firefox/) support:** Provides blazing-fast redirection.
* **Centralized rule management:** Manage rules for all browsers in one place via the native app.
* **Manifest V3 & V2 support:** Redirect Web supports V3 for Chromium-based browsers, and for Firefox, we support V2 to use the same API as Redirector for the flexibility and efficiency.
* **Safari support:** Redirector doesn't support Safari, neither iOS nor macOS while Redirect Web does.

We especially respect Redirector, and we offer importing/exporting redirection rules that Redirector can also handle so you can flexibly switch them. See more details [here](/docs/export-or-import-rules).

## Why not script-based extensions like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)? {#script-based}

Script-based extensions are very powerful and flexible. You can do almost anything with them, including redirection. However, they have some drawbacks compared to Redirect Web:

* **Complexity:** Writing and maintaining scripts can be complex and time-consuming, especially for users who are not familiar with programming. Redirect Web provides a user-friendly interface to create and manage rules without coding.
* **Safety:** Script-based extensions may introduce performance overhead, especially if the scripts are complex or not optimized. They may also make an infinite redirect loop if not carefully written. Redirect Web is designed to be efficient and safe.
* **Newer API support:** Some script-based extensions may not have access to the Declarative Net Request (DNR) API, which can provide faster and more efficient redirection. Redirect Web supports DNR for better performance.

## Why not [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios)? {#why-not-shortcuts}

Shortcuts is a powerful automation tool available on iOS and macOS. You can create shortcuts to perform various tasks, including opening URLs. However, it has some limitations compared to Redirect Web:

## Why not [OpenIn](https://loshadki.app/openin4/)? {#openin}

OpenIn is a popular app that allows you to open links in different apps. It provides a simple way to redirect URLs to specific apps. However, it has some limitations compared to Redirect Web:

* **Auto redirection:** OpenIn requires manual intervention to choose the app each time you open a link. Redirect Web automatically redirects URLs based on your rules without any prompts.
* **Cross-platform support:** OpenIn is primarily designed for Mac. Redirect Web supports multiple browsers on Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Vision Pro.

## Why not [StopTheMadness](https://www.stopthemadness.com/)? {#stopthemadness}

StopTheMadness is a browser extension that provides various features to enhance web browsing, including redirection. However, it has some limitations compared to Redirect Web:

* **Rule flexibility:** StopTheMadness has limited rule configuration options. Redirect Web offers more detailed rule settings, including multiple exclude patterns, capturing group processing, and more.
* **Complexity of features:** StopTheMadness includes many features that may not be necessary for users who only want redirection. Redirect Web focuses solely on redirection.
* **Price:** StopTheMadness costs 12-15 USD and they don't offer trial or a free plan. Redirect Web offers a free plan with basic features, and a subscription with a free trial of all features, and a one-time purchase option for 4 USD.

## Lastly

Redirect Web is not trying to replace these tools but to complement them. The above tools are great in their own ways, and you might find them more suitable for your needs. We encourage you to explore and use the tools that best fit your requirements! üòä

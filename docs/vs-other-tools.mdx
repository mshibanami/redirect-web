## Why not [Redirector](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector)? {#redirector}

Redirector is a great browser extension for redirection. It's completely free and open source, and it works on non-Apple platforms, too. But Redirect Web has some extra features you might like:

* **Detailed rule settings:** Supports multiple exclude patterns, multiple process matches, and string replacement features available only in Redirect Web.
* **Open in native apps:** On Mac, you can choose where to open the target URL. It calls the `open` command directly (not deep linking).
* **[DNR](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2023/05/17/declarativenetrequest-available-in-firefox/) support:** Provides blazing-fast redirection.
* **Centralized rule management:** Manage rules for all browsers in one place via the native app.
* **Manifest V3 & V2 support:** Redirect Web supports V3 on Chromium-based browsers and MV2 on Firefox, allowing use of the same API as Redirector for flexibility and efficiency.
* **Safari support:** Redirect Web supports Safari on iOS and macOS; Redirector does not.

We highly respect Redirector and offer import/export of redirection rules that it can also handle, so you can switch between them flexibly. See more details [here](/docs/export-or-import-rules).

## Why not userscript managers like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)? {#userscript-managers}

Userscript managers are very powerful and flexible. You can do so many things with them, including redirection. However, they have some drawbacks compared to Redirect Web:

* **Complexity:** Writing and maintaining scripts can be complex and time-consuming, especially for users who are not familiar with programming. Redirect Web provides a user-friendly interface to create and manage rules without coding.
* **Safety:** Userscript managers might introduce performance overhead, especially if the scripts are complex or not optimized. They may also cause an infinite redirect loop if not carefully written. Redirect Web is designed to be efficient and safe.
* **Newer API support:** Some userscript managers may not have access to the Declarative Net Request (DNR) API, which can provide faster and more efficient redirection. Redirect Web supports DNR for better performance.

## Why not [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios)? {#why-not-shortcuts}

Shortcuts is Apple's powerful automation tool available on iOS and macOS. You can create shortcuts to perform various tasks, including opening URLs. However, it is triggered manually and is not designed for seamless web browsing.

## Why not [OpenIn](https://loshadki.app/openin4/) or [Velja](https://sindresorhus.com/velja)? {#openin-or-velja}

OpenIn and Velja are both browser picker apps, and they also have browser extensions that let you open links in another app from a browser. Redirect Web also has a browser-to-app redirection capability. However, there are some differences:

* **Automatic redirection:** They require you to manually select their toolbar icon to open a link in another app. Redirect Web automatically redirects URLs based on your rules without extra steps. These are two different approaches to link handling.
* **Cross-platform support:** While they are designed for Mac, Redirect Web supports all major browsers on Mac and Safari on iPhone, iPad, and Apple Vision Pro.

## Why not [StopTheMadness](https://www.stopthemadness.com/)? {#stopthemadness}

StopTheMadness is a browser extension that provides various features to enhance web browsing, including redirection. However, it has some limitations compared to Redirect Web:

* **Rule flexibility:** StopTheMadness has limited rule configuration options. Redirect Web offers more detailed rule settings, including multiple exclude patterns, capturing group processing, and more.
* **Complexity of features:** StopTheMadness includes many features that may not be necessary for users who only want redirection. Redirect Web focuses solely on redirection.
* **Price:** StopTheMadness costs 12-15 USD without a free trial or a free plan. Redirect Web offers a free plan with basic features, and a subscription with a free trial of all features, and a one-time purchase option for the price of a coffee.

## Lastly...

The above tools are great in their own ways, and you might find them more suitable for your needs. We encourage you to explore and use the tools that best fit your requirements! üòä

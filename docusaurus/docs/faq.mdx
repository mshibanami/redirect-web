# FAQ

## Why should I allow the extension to read my information?

You may see an alert like this when you set up Redirect Web:

<img src={require("/img/prepareExtensionPermissionAlert@3x.png").default} alt="An permission requiring alert" width="200" />

> This extension will be able to read and alter webpages and see your browsing history on this website. **This could include sensitive information, including passwords, phone numbers, and credit cards.**

This extension needs your permission to observe the page navigation to redirect to wherever you want to jump, and Safari displays this alert when the extension requests the related permissions. Therefore, if you don’t allow it, this extension can't work.

Since we don't collect your personal information as per **[the privacy policy](./privacy-policy)**, we recommend you **always allow** it on **every website** for your convenience.

But it’s not required. You can only allow it on specific websites. 👌

## Why does this extension require a new permission? :id=permission-alert-on-safari

You may see this alert in Safari after updating Redirect Web:

<img src={require("/img/safari-additional-permission-alert.webp").default} alt="An alert of disabling the app" width="280" />

> "Redirect Web for Safari" has been updated and is requesting additional permissions. To protect your privacy, this extension has been turned off.
>
> You can turn this extension on in the Extensions section of Safari Settings.

This is due to the [declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/blocking_content_with_your_safari_web_extension) permission required by the [DNR](./rule-settings#type) type introduced in version 7. Please re-enable the extension. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## Will the library's contents become paid in the future?

No, it's always free. You can also find the source of all the contents [here](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web/tree/main/docs/library).

## One-time Purchase or Annual Subscription: Which is Best?

We recommend the one-time purchase, as the price difference is only US$2.00.
The main reason we offer the subscription is to allow you to try all the features through its free trial. Here is the expected use case:

1. Subscribe the annual subscription.
2. Immediately cancel the subscription by going to the Settings app, searching for "Subscriptions", tapping on this app, and selecting "Cancel Subscription". This lets you enjoy the free trial without any commitment.
3. Enjoy full access to all features for 7 days.
4. If you like the features, opt for the one-time purchase.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with continuing with the annual subscription if you prefer!

## Why are the toggles of my redirect rules not changing or immediately reverting back?

**Edit (2023-09-01)**: We fixed this bug in version 5.0.0 for both iOS and macOS.

~~It's a bug. Sorry for the inconvenience. As a workaround, try changing the sorting order of one of your redirect rules and then restoring it to the previous order.~~

## Does Redirect Web inject ads or other unrelated content into websites?

No, it does not inject any such content. Only code that is necessary to provide the features described in this documentation and on the app page in the App Store is injected into websites on Safari.

It is possible that in the future, we may choose to show ads to users who have not unlocked the app, but these ads will only be displayed within the app or on this documentation, and not injected into websites.

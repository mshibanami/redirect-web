My work requires me to click on Google Meet links that are sent to me in Mail and Slack but they don't have a great experience in Safari - my default browser - so I have to right click, copy, open Chrome, paste, then go. Except when I forget and then it's a whole different pain. Not any more, though. One quick rule setup to grab any matching URL and open it in Chrome and boom, now I can just click and not have to remember. I'm sure there will be more to come, what with places like my bank and some airlines having sites that don't work well in Safari. I'd rather just use Safari all the time but I can't control what those places do. Now I can at least control how much headache they cause me. Hooray for this app!",

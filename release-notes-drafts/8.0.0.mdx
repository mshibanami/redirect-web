A new major version update! üöÄ

### 1. Multi-browser support on Mac is here!

Redirect Web is now available on **Google Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Microsoft Edge**! This means you can now use Redirect Web on your Mac with your favorite browser, not just Safari.

‚è¨Ô∏è Download links:

- [Google Chrome](https://example.com/)
- [Firefox](https://example.com/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://example.com/)

Please note:

- you still need to download the Redirect Web app from the Mac App Store to use it with these browsers. The app will automatically detect the installed browsers and enable the extension for them.
- The multi-browser support is only available on Mac.

### 2. Changed the main app name to Redirect Web

The former name "Redirect for Safari" has been changed to **Redirect Web** since it now supports multiple browsers on Mac.

### 3. Bug fixes and improvements

- Fixed a bug of the DNR redirection type. Now Redirect Web can set your DNR rules more reliably.
- Rewrite the codebase using [WXT](https://wxt.dev).

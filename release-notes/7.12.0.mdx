* **[macOS]** Fixed an issue where the app initiated redirection while the user was still typing in the address bar. This occurred when a rule was set to redirect to another application.
* **[macOS]** Adjusted the color of the buttons in dark mode for improved visibility. It was too vivid.
* Other minor improvements and bug fixes.

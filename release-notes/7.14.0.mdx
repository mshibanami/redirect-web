* **[macOS]** Added support for Sequoia 15.4
    * Fixed an issue where deep link redirection was not working. (The same change is also applied to iOS extension, which might fix a potential issue.)
* Added support for redirecting to URLs using the Original redirection type, which starts with the following URI schemes:
    * `file:///...` (local file)
    * `data:...` (data URL)
    * **[macOS]** `javascript:...` (JavaScript)
        * This is available only when you enable `Allow JavaScript from Smart Search field` in Safari, which requires system authentication.
* Added a Release Notes section for your convenience.

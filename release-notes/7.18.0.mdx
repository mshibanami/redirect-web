**TL;DR: Only minor changes.**

* Changed the terminology from "Redirect Rule" to just "Rule" to prepare for **potential** future support of [additional DNR actions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/declarativeNetRequest/RuleAction), including `block` and `modifyHeaders`, alongside the existing `redirect` action.
* [iPadOS 18] Fixed an issue where the shooting-star animation, shown when getting a pre-defined rule from the Library, was not displaying correctly.
* Updated the app descriptions on the App Store.
* Localized the app screenshots for the iOS App Store in Japan. (Maybe we'll also localize for other regions soon.)

Also, the app was featured last week in the "Essential Safari Extensions" section on the App Store Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ. Thank you for your continued support! If you enjoy using Redirect Web, please consider leaving a review. It really helps!

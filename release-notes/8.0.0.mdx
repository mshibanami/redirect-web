A new major version update! üöÄ

### 1. Multi-browser support on Mac is here!

![8.0.0 header](/img/release-notes/multi-browser-support.png)

Redirect Web is now available on **Google Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Microsoft Edge**, and other compatible browsers! This means you can now use Redirect Web on your Mac with your favorite browsers, not just Safari.

**‚¨áÔ∏è Download links:**


- [Chrome, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ffglckbhfbfmdkefdmjbhpnffkcmlhdh) (`Chrome Web Store`)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/redirect-web/) (`addons.mozilla.org`)
- [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/hmfkakfdccgdpgemaicfgngnmflefpga) (`microsoftedge.microsoft.com`)
- Safari extension is bundled with [the native app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1571283503).

:::note

- Multi-browser support is only available on Mac.
- Even if you don't use Safari, you still need to download [the Redirect Web app from the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1571283503) to use the extension on non-Safari browsers, as the extensions must communicate with the app to access your rules, settings, and more.

- Since [Firefox still supports Manifest V2](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2024/03/13/manifest-v3-manifest-v2-march-2024-update/), Redirect Web in Firefox uses the webRequestBlocking permission for the Original type, which is a more reliable way to redirect.

### 3. Bug fixes and improvements

- Fixed a bug of the DNR redirection type. Now, Redirect Web can set your DNR rules more reliably.
- Fixed occasional redirection loop caused when you use the `Original` redirection type.
- Improved the performance of the extension by optimizing the background script.
- Stopped adding escape sequences for slashes in the strings in exported rule files. It was unnecessary and only decreased readability.
- [iOS] Fixed the extension popup is not displayed when you enable the App Lock feature on iOS 18 or later.
- [iOS] Added a Change Passcode button to the App Lock settings screen.
- Other minor UI improvements and bug fixes.
    - Fixed the toggle switches for enabling and disabling each rule in the extension popup. Previously, the switch animation was not smooth. It appeared to briefly revert to the previous state when clicked.
    - [iOS] Improved the animation shown when pushing the Get button for a pre-defined rule in the Library.
    - [iOS] Fixed an issue where the title of the Rules screen remained stuck at the top when scrolling.
    - [iPad] Fixed a bug where the navigation bar buttons and the tab bar were misaligned on the Rules tab.
    - [iPad] Restored the screen title of each tab previously removed in iPadOS 18 as a workaround for the alignment issue. Now that the bug is fixed, the titles are shown again.

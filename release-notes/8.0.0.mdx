A new major version update! üöÄ

### 1. Multi-browser support on Mac is here!

Redirect Web is now available on **Google Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Microsoft Edge**, and other compatible browsers! This means you can now use Redirect Web on your Mac with your favorite browser, not just Safari.

‚è¨Ô∏è Download links:

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ffglckbhfbfmdkefdmjbhpnffkcmlhdh) for Chrome, Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi.
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/redirect-web/) for Firefox and Orion.
    - Since [Firefox still supports Manifest V2](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2024/03/13/manifest-v3-manifest-v2-march-2024-update/), Redirect Web uses the `webRequestBlocking` permission for the Original type, which is a more reliable way to redirect.
- [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/hmfkakfdccgdpgemaicfgngnmflefpga) for Edge.

:::note

- You still need to download [the Redirect Web app from the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1571283503) to use the extension on these browsers, as the extensions must communicate with [the native messaging host](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging#native-messaging-host) included in the Redirect Web app bundle to access your rules, settings, and more. The app will automatically detect the installed browsers and activate the extension for them.
- The multi-browser support is only available on Mac.

### 2. Changed the name to just "Redirect Web" for Mac

The former name "Redirect for Safari" for macOS has been changed to **Redirect Web** since it now supports multiple browsers.

### 3. Bug fixes and improvements

- Fixed a bug of the DNR redirection type. Now, Redirect Web can set your DNR rules more reliably.
- Fixed occasional redirection loop caused when you use the `Original` redirection type.
- Improved the performance of the extension by optimizing the background script.
- Stopped adding escape sequences for slashes in the strings in exported rule files. It was unnecessary and only decreased readability.
- [iOS] Fixed the extension popup is not displayed when you enable the App Lock feature on iOS 18 or later.
- [iOS] Added a Change Passcode button to the App Lock settings screen.
- Other minor UI improvements and bug fixes.
    - Fixed the toggle switches for enabling and disabling each rule in the extension popup. Previously, the switch animation was not smooth. It appeared to briefly revert to the previous state when clicked.
    - [iOS] Improved the animation shown when pushing the Get button for a pre-defined rule in the Library.
    - [iOS] Fixed an issue where the title of the Rules screen remained stuck at the top when scrolling.
    - [iPad] Fixed a bug where the navigation bar buttons and the tab bar were misaligned on the Rules tab.
    - [iPad] Restored the screen title of each tab previously removed in iPadOS 18 as a workaround for the alignment issue. Now that the bug is fixed, the titles are shown again.

### 4. Other internal changes

We also refined the codebase using [WXT](https://wxt.dev) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). The overall code quality of the extension has dramatically improved, making it easier to maintain and extend the app in the future.

* [Mac] Fixed a crash that occurred when opening a URL in an app that doesn’t support it. For example, the Figma app doesn’t handle https links because they aren’t listed in its `Info.plist`. Attempting to open `https://figma.com/...` in Figma via Redirect Web caused the extension to crash. This wasn’t obvious at first because Safari automatically relaunched the extension, but since we now support non-Safari browsers that lack crash recovery, it became a major bug for them.

* Extension Popup: Fixed that the toggle switches of enabling/disabling the rules were misaligned.
* [Chrome, Firefox] Extension Popup: Fixed that some texts were too small.

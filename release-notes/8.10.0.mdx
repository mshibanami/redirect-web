    In addition, on iOS, now that this feature is available, the app and the extension popup also show the Enable Rules toggle.

    (To use this feature, please update both the app and the extension to the latest versions.)

* Fixed an issue where confusing errors appeared in Safari’s extension settings window on Mac. ([#96](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web/issues/96))
* Improved reliability of in-app purchase processing.

* [macOS] Fixed an issue where extensions for Firefox couldn't connect to the Redirect Web app. The problem occurred when the [folder for manifest files of native messaging hosts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests#macos) didn't exist. Mozilla considers it the browser’s responsibility to create this folder, but they haven't done so as noted in [their 8-year-old bug report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1367100). To address this, we added a check that creates the folder if it's missing. This fallback mechanism is applied to all supported browsers just in case.

(The recent major update is [here](./8.0.0.mdx) in case you missed it!)

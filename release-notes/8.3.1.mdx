* [Firefox] Fixed an issue where the extension didn't handle in-page navigation correctly. This issue caused a problem where the redirection didn't happen on sites like Google Maps, for example.

This version is only available for the extension in Firefox Add-ons (AMO). There is no equivalent version for other browsers or the native app.

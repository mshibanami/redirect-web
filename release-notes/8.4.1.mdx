* Fixed an issue where [soft line breaks](https://github.github.com/gfm/#soft-line-breaks) in rule comments written in Markdown were ignored. (Our Markdown implementation is supposed to follow [GitHub's Markdown style](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).)
* [Mac] The Edit Rule screen has some options you can remove its items, such as *Excluded URL Patterns*, but the buttons to remove them were hard to press. Now they are easier to press.

(This version is only for the app that is available in the App Store.)

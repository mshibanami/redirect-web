* Fixed an issue where the DNR rule didn't work when opening the browser with a URL (e.g., when clicking a link in another app to open it in the browser).
    * To address this, we changed the DNR rules from Session Rules, which reset every time the browser launches, to Dynamic Rules, which persist across browser launches. [Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/declarativeNetRequest#rulesets)
    * Previously, we intentionally used Session Rules as a workaround for an issue where unnecessary rules sometimes remained enabled. However, since version 8.0.0, this issue has been resolved, so we can now use Dynamic Rules.
* Fixed a minor UI issue related to popovers.

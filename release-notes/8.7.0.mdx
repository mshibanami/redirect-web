* **All library rules are now translated!** Previously, the rule titles and descriptions were only available in English, but now they are translated into multiple languages based on your device's settings.
* Fixed an issue where the default rule description in Korean was not displayed correctly.
* Fixed minor UI issues in the native app and the extension popup.

* We changed the app’s brand name to **RedirectWeb** from Redirect Web.
* Moved the support website to **[redirectweb.net](https://redirectweb.net)** from [mshibanami.github.io/redirect-web](https://mshibanami.github.io/redirect-web). Now the old URL will redirect to the new one automatically.

The owner and the developer of RedirectWeb remain Manabu Nakazawa, as before.

### Updated Terms & Privacy Policy

Since we changed the app’s brand name to RedirectWeb, we also updated our [Terms of Use](/terms-of-use) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) to reflect the renaming. Find the full diff [here](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web/commit/0d4fcaeb254d5571c9ba302ae035ea4e6f223eec).
